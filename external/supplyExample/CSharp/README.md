# HERE Mobility Supply API - Client & Example Project - C#

This repository contains several projects grouped into a single solution:
1. HMSupplySDK - Autogenerated client and server libraries for Supply API and Dispatch API
2. PartnerClientExample - Example of a Supply API client which updates the HERE Mobility Marketplace on ride status
3. PartnerInsecureServerExample - Example of an insecure Dispatch API server, which receives GetRideOffers, CreateRide and CancelRide requests from the Marketplace.
4. PartnerSecureServerExample - Example of a secure Dispatch API server (incl. example certificates to be replaced), which receives GetRideOffers, CreateRide and CancelRide requests from the Marketplace.

When developing an integration with the Marketplace, you would implement a Supply API client and a Dispatch API server.  THe Marketplace will send ride requests to the Dispatch API server, and will expect ride updates to arrive via the Supply API client. 

Two additional projects are provided to help with the example:
1. HMServerSimulator - simulates a simple HERE Marketplace Server. The server expects ride updates from the partner. 
2. HMInsecureClientSimulator - simulates a simple HERE Marketplace Client, which will send ride requests to the Partner's server. 
3. HMSecureClientSimulator - simulates a simple HERE Marketplace Client, which will send ride requests to the Partner's server on a secured channel. (incl. example of the server's public key to be replaced)
